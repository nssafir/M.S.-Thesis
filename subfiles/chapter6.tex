    \contentchapter{Results}
    - Overall: can this outperform plain metric learning with the same number of labels?
    \section{Claim 1: Usefulness of reconstruction loss}
    - Could set beta of VAE (KL divergence coefficient) to 0 and see what happens
    \section{Claim 2: Incorporating Inductive Bias with loss term}
    - Test vanilla VAE vs VAE with VampPrior, evaluate performance plus if the VAE with VampPrior includes clustering that makes sense
    - Setting number of pseudo inputs
