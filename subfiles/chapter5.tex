    \section{MLVAE Architecture}
    - We just use the training routine of the VAE but add the metric loss to the loss function \\
    - Metric losses we are using: triplet loss, supervised contrastive loss, other loss function, moran's I (maybe), geodesic metric loss (also maybe)
    - Other Implementation quirks: how we need to adjust training routine bc metric losses need greater batch sizes than vae loss, etc.
    \section{MLVAE Loss Functions}
    \section{Computing the Geodesic Loss}
    \section{Evaluation of Latent Space}
    - Use an MLP or kNN classifier \\
    - Discussion other measures
