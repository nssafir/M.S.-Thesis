# UGA Thesis/Dissertation LaTeX Template
A dissertation/thesis template in LaTeX. This repository is based-off of a [UGA Graduate School approved Latex Template created by DigiLab of UGA](https://github.com/DigiUGA/UGA-Dissertation-LaTeX-Template). The goal of this repository is to reduce some of the legwork in writing your thesis/dissertation. The reason for this updated repository is that the approved template appears not to strictly adhere to the Graduate School's [style guidelines](https://grad.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/theses_and_dissertations-STYLE-GUIDE-compressed.pdf). The edits made here are meant to more accurately meet these guidelines, but no assurances are given.

NOTE: This repository has NOT been approved by the Graduate School, but was created to better meet their own guidelines than existing templates.
